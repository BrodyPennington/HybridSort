# HybridSort

## Written by Brody Pennington for CSE 4833 Intro to Analysis of Algorithms

HybridSort is an algorithm that combines Selection Sort and Merge Sort to create the "hybrid."
When the array size is larger than 280, it will swap from Selection to Merge sort.

The source code for both the selection sort and the merge sort can be found on GeeksforGeeks.com.
